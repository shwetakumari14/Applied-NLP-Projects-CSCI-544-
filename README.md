# Applied Natural Language Projects

##### This repository contains four distinct NLP mini projects completed as part of the CSCI 544 course, along with the corresponding outcomes.

#### Assignment 1
* This assignment focuses on you hands-on experience with text representations and the use of text classification for sentiment analysis. 
* Sentiment analysis is extensively used to study customer behaviors using reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for marketing and costumer service applications.  

#### Assignment 2
* This assignment focuses on hands-on experience on using HMMs on part-ofspeech tagging. We will use the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank to build an HMM model for part-of-speech tagging. 
* In the files of train and dev, contains sentences with human-annotated part-of-speech tags. 
* In the file of test, contains only the raw sentences and we need to predict the part-of-speech tags for those sentences. 

#### Assignment 3
* For this assignment we will generate Word2Vec features for the dataset we generated in Assignment 1.
* Using the Google pre-trained Word2Vec features, we will train a single perceptron and an SVM model for the classification problem.
* Using the Word2Vec features, we will train a feedforward multilayer perceptron network
and a recurrent neural network (RNN) for classification.

#### Assignment 4
* This assignment focuses on hands-on experience on building deep learning models on named entity recognition (NER). We will use the CoNLL-2003 corpus to build a neural network for NER. 
* Similar to Assignment 2, in the files of train and dev, contains the sentences with human-annotated NER tags. And in the file of test, contains the raw sentences.
